STAR WARS: Battle of Endor

Goal: Destroy 100 Tie-Fighters while piloting your X-Wing before they destroy your Ship or Base.

Instructions:
A - Shoot Left Blaster
B - Shoot Right Blaster
D PAD - Steer X-Wing
SELECT - Restart Game

Your semi-autopilot system prevents you from crashing into other Tie-Fighters. However, Just like classic Space Invaders, a blaster is on cool down until its previous shot hits another target (or the top of the screen). Accurate aim is a major key! 

Tip: The closer you get to your target, it is better in your ships lock range and you will destroy your target faster.  

Gameplay Info:
Base and Ship start out at 100% health.
Tie-Fighters take up to two X-Wing blaster shots before being destroyed.
Tie-Fighters blaster shots do -1% damage on your Ship and Base.
Tie-Fighters that land in your base do -5% damage to the base.

Level 1 - Less than 25 Tie-Fighters Destroyed: Simple enemies spawn that do not shoot at your ship or base, but can still land on your base and do damage.
Level 2 - After 25 Tie-Fighters Destroyed: Medium enemies spawn that can shoot as well as land.
Level 3 - After 50 Tie-Fighters Destroyed: Hard enemies spawn that are exactly like the Medium enemies except they are faster.
Level 4 - After 75 Tie Figheters Destroyed: Insane enemies spawn that are exactly like the Hard enemies except they spawn more frequently, are slightly faster, and shoot more rapidly.
